# School Contacts
This is a MERN stack that displays the school name and administrative contacts for 508 public schools.

The homepage lists all the schools with block below the name. Each block represent a contact for that school. The color signifies whether they have been emailed or not. Green means they have been emailed. White means they have not been emailed.

Clicking on a school name redirects you to another page where the contacts are listed out. If the contact is greyed out, that means they have been emailed already. Clicking on the email icon for a contact that has not been emailed already will open an email draft to the associated email address.

Below is a video demonstrating the app.
